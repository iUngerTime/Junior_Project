Conventions:
  FOR DATABASE
    -Table name is ALL CAPS. (examples are: PERSON, INGREDIENT, PANTRY)
    -Pascal Casing for collumn names within tables. First letter of each word is capitalized, no spaces. (examples are: UserName, MyHome)
    -ID tags are capitalized. (examples are: UserID, IngredientID)
    -Comments are useful and neccessary, use them for every table as a breif description.
